# Assesment

I designed the site like this to look eye catching and user-friendly by the use of bright red colours over a bland pale off-white background to really standout.
Nav buttons at the top as well as at the center of the home page to make accessability easier. I also added a hyperlink to the "Welcome To London" homepage text which should take you to the map which is at the bottom of the page. 
I went for a middlevil & modern theme to emphasize on how old and historic the city of london really is, hence the font in the history page and the tone and design of the banner. 
Apart from the Images on the visit page, the images used on my site were designed by me in Adobe Illustrator + Photoshop, including the banner, and the history page scroll.
The biggest challenges i faced were alligning the text to the scroll and constanly resizing it to fit, as well as trying to pack the text to fit into the columns on the visit page.
